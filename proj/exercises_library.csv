Keep body straight and slowly lean forward from the knees, resisting the descent. Use hands to catch yourself if needed, then push back up.
To control the descent to the floor in the second half of the movement, use a band around your chest attached behind and above you
 - this ensures full activation under a full range of motion.
This exercise primarily builds eccentric, i.e. going down, strength.
The position of the ankle, plantarflexed, i.e. toes pointed down, or dorsiflexed, i.e. toes pointed up, makes the exercise more difficult, or easier, respectively.","Maintain straight body line, Engage hamstrings","6,7"

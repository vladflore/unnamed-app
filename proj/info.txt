This site is my ongoing experiment in mixing code with kettlebells. It’s very much a <span style="background-color: #BA945E; color: white;">work in progress</span>—kind of like my mobility—but it’s getting better every day (also like my mobility).

You’ll find a <span style="background-color: #BA945E; color: white;">variety of fitness exercises</span> here, complete with <span style="background-color: #BA945E; color: white;">clear instructions</span> so you don’t end up doing bicep curls with your lower back. I’ll be adding more features and content as time (and caffeine) permits.

If you like what you see and want to fuel the next round of improvements, <span style="background-color: #BA945E; color: white;">feel free to buy me a drink</span>. There’s a big shiny button at the bottom of the page—it’s hard to miss, just like leg day (please don’t skip it).
